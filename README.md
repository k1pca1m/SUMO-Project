# Real-Time Traffic Simulation with Java
🚦 Project: Real-Time Traffic Simulation with SUMO & Java

This project implements a real-time traffic simulation platform using the SUMO mobility engine and TraaS (Traffic Control as a Service) Java API. The goal is to create an interactive, object-oriented system that visualizes traffic flow, controls traffic lights, injects vehicles, and generates analytics — all in real time.

The application is designed according to the official project description and milestone requirements of the OOP in Java course (Winter Semester 2025/26).
Includes: architecture design, GUI, TraaS wrapper, analytics, error handling, multithreading, file export, clean code and documentation.
